;document-popularity strategy for consumers and producers, with major and minor taste (70%-30%)
; Note
 ;The difference between the producers and consumers is that:1.  producers publish new documents
 ; in addition to consumers actions, which are like and follow. 2. the payoff of consumers and producers
 ; are calculated differently. 
 
 ;Producers collaborate by liking and following of other peers, and thus they act as a consumer for other producers
