3. Uncomment your desired setting of the experience in the experiment source code
4. change the name of the breeds to the ones in experiment in plot.nls

5. Select Behavioural Space from tools section. Select RunMultipleTimes. And run the experiment. 
This would run the experiment 10 times, with the seeds 100, 200, ... 1000.
