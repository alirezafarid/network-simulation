In this section, each ranking strategy is experimented separately.

Two different settings of each experiment are Uniform taste consumers and Major-Minor taste consumers. The result of the simulation for each setting is located in their correspondent folder.

The experimented startegies are: 

  * Random
  * Document-popularity
  * Peer-Popularity
  * Peer-like-similarity
  * Peer-follow-similarity
  * Peer-distance

Also, We manually created the results of best case and worst case strategies to use them as a yardstick for measuring the performance of  other strategies.
