This folder contains all the simulation experiments and their results. It includes the following parts similar to order of experiments in the paper: 

+ Part1-Uniform-MajorMinor
  In this section, each ranking strategy experiments separately with two different settings: Uniform taste consumers and Major-Minor taste consumers. The result of the tests of each setting is located in their correspondent folder.

+ Part2-Mix:
  Two strategies are used within each experiment. Each experiment includes two settings. In the first setting, Majority of peers use one ranking strategy, and the minority of peers use the other ranking strategy. And, the second setting is the reverse of  majorities and minorities in using the strategies 

+ Part3-Producer: 
 This experiment studies the effect of the majority and minority on the producer's payoff.   

+ Part4-DoNothing: 
 This experiment explores the effect of leeches or peers who do not contribute to the network- they do not like any documents and do not follow any other peers.
